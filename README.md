# Semi Supervised Representation Learning
This is an architecture that uses a Variational Autoencoder based on the ResNet18-architecture, implemented in PyTorch.

We will change the VAE architecture a bit and add some other blocks to it.
The goal is to do semi supervised learning using Cifar10 dataset and evaluate the performance of the model.  

The implementation of the VAE is inspired by the forked project.
